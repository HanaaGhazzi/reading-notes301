# What is jQuery? 

_jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code._

## Why you need jQuery

**Let's recap some of the advantages to using jQuery in your next Web development project.**

- The price is right. The jQuery library is free.
- It's light. Since jQuery pushes content to the client, it therefore reduces the wait time for server response. Plus, it's smaller than Flash, so it results in smoother playbacks and less errors.
- It works anywhere. HTML5 is cross-browser compatible-it will work on any browser, mobile phone or tablet, and even on Apple devices.
- There's a low learning curve. Since it's based on plain old JavaScript, developers can learn jQuery fast.
- Finally, jQuery is SEO friendly and CSS3 compliant.
