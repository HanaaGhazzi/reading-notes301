# What,How and Why Node.js! 

## What is Node.js?
_**Node.js** is an open-source, Javascript runtime environment on Chrome’s V8 that lets you effortlessly develop fast and scalable web applications. It utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight, efficient and excellent for data-intensive real-time applications that run across shared devices._

## What Is Node.js Used For?

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded. If this real-time aspect of Node is something you’d like to look into more, check out our tutorial on Building a Real-time Chat App.


> Node.js is used primarily for web applications, but it’s starting to get used more and more often for developing enterprise apps, too, thanks to its versatility.
