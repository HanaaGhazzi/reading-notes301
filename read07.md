# What Google Learned About the Perfect Team


> “We had lots of data, but nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference.”

> “The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter,” according to Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division

The article profiles a 25-year-old Yale School of Management student, Julia Rozovsky, who participated in two study groups, hoping to find one she enjoyed. She found that both groups had people who were bright and outgoing. However, one group had people jockeying for leadership positions, criticizing one another’s ideas, and experiencing conflicts around who was in charge. The other group was quite different – it was warm and friendly. According to a study published in the Harvard Business Review:

With businesses becoming more global and complex, employees are spending a majority of their day communicating in teams.

Yet there has been little agreement, until now, on exactly what distinguishes the high functioning teams from the rest.

In 2012, Google launched Project Aristotle – a quest to build the perfect team. They studied 180 teams to figure out why some faltered and others succeeded. They found no evidence that the composition of the team was influential in the outcomes. What they found was this:

- psychological safety was clearly vital to a team’s success. This includes “equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking” and “average social sensitivity” (which means being intuitive to expressions, tone of voice and other nonverbal clues).

- Bottom line: What mattered was a feeling – the feeling of being safe. Members of a team perform best when they feel safe. Feeling safe is about having equal time to talk. This means not feeling stunted, cut off, or criticized about what you have to say when you choose to speak up in front of the team.

Google’s researchers concluded that it is not a matter of whether people are competitive or analytical, introverted or extroverted, etc., but that they are happiest in teams where they feel safe. Feeling safe is the secret ingredient to a team’s success.
