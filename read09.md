# What is functional programming?
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia.

### Functions as first-class entities can:

- pass it as a parameter to other functions
- return it as result from other functions

#### Reduce
The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
